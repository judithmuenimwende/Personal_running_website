		<p>My name is Judith Mueni.I am currently pursuing Diploma at Akirachix institution and for the past 7months i have been able to design alot of layouts. I have been able to come up with my own logo, i designed it in a way it could represent who exactly i am. <br> Its my own brand and i locate from my logo. I have learned on how to use adobe photoshop, indesign and illustrator. I can design magazine and newspaper through the experience i have received from my graphic design tutor. Believing that by the end of the year i would be able to do alot. <br> I will use all my skills that i have gained in a company i will be employed in. Akirachix has been a good experience for me, it has really taught me alot of new things i never knew before. I am time keeper, i can work with a team, i can work under pressure, i can submit my designs on time. <br> 
		I have also learned coding and programmg. I am familiar with some languages like Python, Java, Javascript and Html&Css. Through Html&Css, i have been able to create a portfolio website. The website contains everything about myself. Through Python and Javascript, i have been able to create a task manager where i keep my tasks and it reminds me of what am supposed to do. </p>
